# Manual Add Feature for Processed Foods

## Overview
Added the ability to manually add processed food items without scanning a label, providing flexibility for users who want to enter nutritional information from memory or other sources.

## Changes Made

### 1. UI Updates (index.html)
- **Added "Add" icon button** next to the camera button in the Processed page header
- Button uses the same plus icon (+) style as Cook and Eat pages
- **Updated modal** to support both "Add" and "Edit" modes:
  - Added brand field
  - Title changes based on mode ("Add Processed Food" vs "Edit Processed Food")
  - Delete button only shows in edit mode
  - Submit button text is just "Save" for both modes

### 2. JavaScript Updates (processed.js)

#### New Method: `openManualAdd()`
- Opens the modal in create mode
- Sets title to "Add Processed Food"
- Hides the delete button
- Clears the form for new entry
- Sets `currentEditId` to null

#### Updated Method: `editProcessedFood(foodId)`
- Opens the modal in edit mode
- Sets title to "Edit Processed Food"
- Shows the delete button
- Populates form with existing data
- Sets `currentEditId` to the food ID
- Now includes brand field

#### Updated Method: `saveProcessedFood()`
- Checks if `currentEditId` is set
- If editing: Updates existing food
- If creating: Adds new food
- Validates that name is required
- Handles brand field (optional)
- Shows appropriate toast message

### 3. CSS Updates (styles.css)
- **Added `page-header-actions`** class for grouping header buttons
- Buttons have 0.5rem gap between them
- Flex display for proper alignment

## User Interface
