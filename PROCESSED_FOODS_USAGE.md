# How to Use the Processed Foods Feature

## Quick Start

   - Click the üì¶ "Processed" tab in the bottom navigation (between Record and Cook)

2. **Scan a food label**
   - Click the camera icon button in the page header
   - Your device camera will open (or file picker on desktop)
   - Take a clear photo of the nutrition label
   - Wait for AI to process (loading indicator will appear)

3. **Review the scanned food**
   - The food will automatically appear in your list
   - An edit dialog opens for you to review/adjust the information
   - Verify: name, calories per 100g, serving size, calories per serving
   - Click "Save Changes" when satisfied

4. **Add to your daily log**
   
   **Option A - Quick Add:**
   - Enter the amount in grams (e.g., 150)
   - Click "Add to Eat (Today)"
   - Done! It's added to today's food log
   
   **Option B - More Options:**
   - Click "More Options..." button

## Tips

- **Take clear photos**: Make sure the nutrition facts table is well-lit and in focus
- **Edit if needed**: The AI is good but not perfect - always review the extracted data
- **Save frequently used items**: Once scanned, the food stays in your Processed list for quick future use
- **Use servings when available**: If you know you ate "2 cookies", use servings instead of weighing
